# üöÄ Neovim Configuration

This project is my custom **Neovim configuration** built with **Lua** to optimize productivity for web development, whether you are a front-end or back-end developer. It features a modular setup with tools to streamline coding, debugging, and version control workflows. Whether you're navigating large codebases or managing Git repositories, this configuration has you covered.
I did this as a fun project to do outside of my studies in computer science. I want to focus primarily on back-end architecture and use this project as a learning experience to propel forward in what I want to achieve in technology.
